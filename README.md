AI_Text_Summarizer
<br>
Introduction
<br>
The AI Writer with Text Summarization is a web-based application that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically condense large articles or documents into concise summaries. The tool is particularly useful for students, researchers, journalists, and content creators who need to extract key information quickly without reading the entire text.

AI_Story_Generator
<br>
Introduction
<br>
The AI Dungeon Story Generator is an interactive text-based storytelling application that uses natural language generation (NLG) techniques to create engaging, genre-specific narratives. Inspired by classic text-based adventure games, this project allows users to input a prompt and receive multiple creative story continuations powered by advanced generative models. The goal is to simulate a dynamic dungeon master or storyteller capable of generating rich, immersive tales across multiple genres like fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery.

<br>
Tool/Library & Purpose
<br>
Python	Core programming language
<br>
Hugging Face Transformers	Provides GPT-2/GPT-Neo models for text generation
<br>
Torch (PyTorch)	Deep learning backend used by the models
<br>
Gradio	Rapid web app framework for deployment
<br>
Datetime & OS	Utility modules for file saving and timestamps
